Navigation Button Navigation Tool Description Clicking plus (+) and (-) zoom the map in and out. By default, the map uses the Bing Maps scale. The home button returns the map to the default extent (statewide). These buttons allow the user to navigate to previous and next extents while using the map. The locate icon ceneters on your location. Location Services must be enabled Keyboard Navigation Navigating the map by using the keyboard is very effective. Zooming, panning, and other actions can be performed with a keystroke or combined keystroke and mouse action. Panning the map can be achived using the arrows keys on the keyboard. The UP arrow pans North, the DOWN arrow pans South, the RIGHT arrow pans East, and the LEFT arrow pans West. Zooming in and out can be achieved by using the Shift key and either the \"+\" or the \"-\" key on a numeric keypad. Another great way to zoom in is to hold down on the Shift key and then click and drag a rectangle on the map to define the zoom area. See the table below for some examples. Keystroke Map Action Up arrow Pans north Down arrow Pans south Right arrow Pans east Left arrow Pans west N Aligns map to the north Shift and drag Zoom in by drawing a rectangle Shift and click Zoom in to the pointer location Ctrl + click Center view on pointer location Mouse Navigation Navigating the map can also be done with the mouse. Scroll the mouse wheel forward or up to zoom in or backward to zoom out. Hold the Shift key down, then hold the left mouse button down and drag to draw a rectangle. The map will zoom in to the area of the rectangle. See the table below for some combinations. Keystroke Action Left Click Pop-up / Pan Wheel Zoom in & out Right Click & Hold Rotate Shift + Left + Drag Draw a rectangle to zoom Working with Layers Base Layers Users have the ability to switch base layers depending on their needs or interests. Some people prefer a street map based view while others like to see landcover, topography, and aerial images as they zoom in closer and closer. These different base layers can be activated using the Base Map Gallery widget that is located with the other tools in the map viewer header. Users have the ability to use the Kentucky Base Map, the Kentucky Topography Map, Aerials from different years, or Esri's topographic or street base. Simply click on the desired base map to make it active. Figure: The web apps provide a variety of base map layers ranging from Kentucky-based layers, Esri-based Layers, Open Street Map and USGS. Thematic Layers Thematic, or operational, layers are usually the primary focus of the site. Things such as the weather radar, state parks, wastewater treatment plants, and geodetic control points are examples of thematic layers. These layers can be activated by checking the box to the left of the layer name. Clicking on the little pulldown menu to the right of the layer name allows the users to set the transparency, open the attribute table, move it up or down in the list, or zoom to its full extent. Search The search tool leverages different geocoding services to enable searching for a geolocation. Location types include address, coordinates, named places, etc. We recommend using the KY NG911 Locator for best results. Getting Map Coordinates Obtaining a Map Coordinate: The Coordinate Widget is positioned in the lower left corner of the map viewer just above the graphic scale bar. Note that moving the mouse causes the values to change based on the current position of the mouse on the map. To obtain a map coordinate, click on the icon at the left of the coordinate values. Doing this changes the mode of the coordinate tool to allow for getting map coordinates that can be copied. Note that the tool now says Click the map to get coordinates . Then, simply click on the map and the coordinate value will be placed in the tool. If you need to copy the value, select the copy icon and hit Ctrl + C , then paste the value where you desire. You can also change the coordinate system for the map tool but clicking the arrow button on the right. Inset Map In the lower right corner, there is a smaller arrow that toggles open an inset map. This provides relative location when zoomed at very high scales. Nexrad Widget Note: Currently, this widget is only available in the KyWeather App The Nexrad Widget displays the Iowa Environment Mesonet generated NEXRAD Mosaics for the last hour in five minute intervals. Dropdown Description This dropdown menu provides a selection of intervals in seconds in which to cylce through the 11 layers. This dropdown menus changes the opacity of the layers.","title":"Map"},{"location":"map/#map","text":"The map layout may vary from app to app but the map tool functionality will be consistent.","title":"Map"},{"location":"map/#navigation","text":"","title":"Navigation"},{"location":"map/#button-navigation","text":"Tool Description Clicking plus (+) and (-) zoom the map in and out.
