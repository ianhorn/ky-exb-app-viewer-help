Location types include address, coordinates, named places, etc. We recommend using the KY NG911 Locator for best results. Getting Map Coordinates Obtaining a Map Coordinate: The Coordinate Widget is positioned in the lower left corner of the map viewer just above the graphic scale bar. Note that moving the mouse causes the values to change based on the current position of the mouse on the map. To obtain a map coordinate, click on the icon at the left of the coordinate values. Doing this changes the mode of the coordinate tool to allow for getting map coordinates that can be copied. Note that the tool now says \"Click the map to get coordinates\". Then, simply click on the map and the coordinate value will be placed in the tool. If you need to copy the value, select it in the tool and hit Ctrl + C then paste the value where you desire. You can also change the coordinate system for the map tool but clicking the arrow button on the right. Inset Map In the lower right corner, there is a smaller arrow the toggles open an inset map. This provides relative location when zoomed at very high scales.
